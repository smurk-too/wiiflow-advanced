Since I refuse to work with people who can't grasp simple programming concepts or even attempt to preserve a project's basic essence, my work on Wiiflow will now be in this project.  I will not rush to give you the latest features when the project is not stable enough to continue adding things, or when the feature cannot be implemented well yet, but I will make sure you have all the latest features when they are appropriate.  Primary focus will be on stable and efficient code.
