= WiifloWiki =
Since the changes to wiiflow have been coming so fast, it has been hard to keep up with the readmes and communicating instructions to use new features to our faithful followers.  In order to simplify it, and allow people to contribute to this information, we have started a  wiki at *[http://www.wiiflowiki.com www.wiiflowiki.com]*

This wiki is yet incomplete but contains alot of very useful information about almost anything you can ask about wiiflow.  

*If you wish to add something or become a contributor to this wiki:*

PM miigotu(mugotu) or r-win on gbatemp.net, or ask us directly on the irc chat at *irc.abjects.net/wiiflow*
